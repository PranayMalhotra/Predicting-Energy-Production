# PREDICTING ENERGY PRODUCTION

## Introduction

This is a LInear Regression project which aims to predict the amount of energy(power) produced by the Combined Cycle Power Plant(CCPP).

## Problem Statement

A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. The task is to predict the amount of energy produced according to the data present.

## Data

The dataset contains columns giving values for Ambient Temperature, Exhaust Vaccum, Ambient Pressure, Relative Humidity and Energy Ouput. The data was collected over a six year period (2006-11).

The dataset is present in the repository or else can be downloaded from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/combined+cycle+power+plant).

# Requirements

The project was done in Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.
